\begin{document}

There are 8 problems in this set. You must complete 6 (doing more will get no
credit - work on your project!) 3 of the problems (you choose) are due on September 12,
and the rest of the problems you complete are due on September 19. Feel
free to work with other students, but make sure you write up the homework
and code on your own (no copying homework \textit{or} code; no pair programming).
Feel free to ask students or instructors for help debugging code or whatever else,
though. Problems are in no specific order.
